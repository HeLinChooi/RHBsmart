            content: `<br>Investing and trading are two distinct approaches to profiting from the financial markets. Market involvement is profitable for both investors and traders. Buying and holding, in general, is used by investors to achieve higher returns over a longer period of time. Traders, on the other hand, use both rising and falling markets to join and leave positions more quickly, resulting in smaller, more frequent profits.

            <br>
            <br> <b>What is investing? </b>
            <br>Investing is a 'buy-and-hold' strategy with a longer time horizon. Investors frequently retain assets for years, if not decades, with the goal of profiting handsomely from rising asset prices and any income created over time.
            An investor's precise time horizon (the amount of time they plan to invest) is determined by their financial goals. Someone investing for retirement, for example, may have a time horizon of 20 years or more. Someone saving for a down payment on a home, on the other hand, may have a five-year time horizon.
            The larger the possible return of an investment, the higher the risk of that investment, according to a basic investing principle. The 'risk-return tradeoff' is what it's called. The risk of an investment's actual returns differing from its predicted returns is referred to as risk.
            The longer an investor's time horizon, the more opportunities for higher-growth, higher-risk investments become available to them. This is due to the fact that they have greater time to weather market turbulence. If an investor has a shorter time horizon, they must be more conservative in their investing choices, or they risk not meeting their financial objectives.
            The fact that financial markets rise and fall in the short term is accepted by most investors. As a result, they will frequently ride out times of underperformance in the hope that asset values would eventually recover and any short-term losses will be made up.
            

            <br><br> <b>What is trading?  </b>
            <br>Trading is a more aggressive and short-term strategy compared to investing. 
             Traders tend to hold assets for  much shorter periods of time than investors and often buy and sell securities within weeks, days and even hours to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. 
             Investors primarily seek to profit from rising asset prices, while traders seek to profit from both rising and falling asset prices. Instead of focusing on the long-term growth prospects of an asset like investors, traders focus on the direction in which  the  price of the asset may move next and seek to profit from that price movement. increase. While 
              investors often survive periods of stagnation, traders are more likely to use "stop-loss" orders to automatically close lost transactions at a given price level. This helps  protect trading capital. 
              trading usually takes longer than investing. Investors can buy stocks and funds and forget about them, but traders need to  constantly monitor market trends.

            description: "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become extremely popular with traders and investors in recent years for good reason...",
            content: `<br><b>What is an ETF?</b>  
            <br>An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks indexes, sectors, commodities, or other assets, but  can be bought and sold on the exchange just like regular stocks. ETFs can be configured to track everything from the price of a single commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can also be configured to follow specific investment strategies. 
            
            <br><br>A well-known example is the SPDR S & P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S & P 500 index. ETFs can hold different types of assets, including stocks, commodities, bonds, or different types of assets. Exchange-traded funds are marketable securities. H. There are related prices that make buying and selling easier. 
            <br><br>ETFs are called exchange-traded funds because they are traded on exchanges like stocks. ETF stock prices fluctuate throughout the trading day as stocks are bought and sold in the market. This is different from a trust that is not traded on the exchange and is traded only once a day after the market closes. In addition, ETFs tend to be cheaper and more liquid than investment trusts. 
            <br><br><b>Types of ETFs </b>
            <br>There are several types of ETFs available to investors that can be used to generate income, speculate, raise prices, and  hedge or partially offset the risk of an investor's portfolio. Here is a brief description of some of the ETFs available on the market today. 
            <br><br><b>Bond ETFs </b>
            <br>Bond ETFs are used to provide investors with regular income. The distribution of returns depends on the performance of the underlying bond. These include government bonds, corporate bonds, and government and municipal bonds, so-called municipal bonds. Unlike  underlying assets, bond ETFs  have no maturity date. They are usually traded at a premium or discount to the actual bond price. 
            <br><br><b>Stock ETFs</b>
            <br>Stock ETF consists of a basket of stocks that represent a single industry or sector. For example, a stock ETF may track a car or foreign stock. It aims to provide diverse exposures to a single industry, including high performers and newcomers with growth potential. Unlike equity investment trusts, stock ETFs have low fees and do not include ownership of the actual securities. 
            <br><br><b>Industry ETFs </b>
            <br>Industry or Sector ETFs are funds focused on a particular industry or industry. For example,  energy sector ETFs include companies operating in this sector. The idea behind industry ETFs is to touch on the benefits of this industry by tracking the performance of companies doing business in this sector. One example is the technology sector, which has seen an inflow of funds in recent years. At the same time, the downsides of ETFs' highly volatile equity performance are curtailed as they do not involve direct ownership of securities. Industrial ETFs are also used to rotate inside and outside the sector during the business cycle. 
            <br><br><b>Commodity ETFs </b> 
            <br>As the name implies, Commodity ETFs invest in commodities such as crude oil and gold. Commodity ETFs have several advantages. First, it diversifies the portfolio and makes it easier to hedge the recession. Commodity ETFs, for example,  can provide cushioning during stock market downturns. Second, owning a stake in a commodity ETF is cheaper than physically owning the commodity. In the former case, there is no insurance or storage cost.

            title: "Structured Product Investments",
            description: "Structured Investment (or Structured Product) is a hybrid financial instrument whose performance is linked to the your choice of underlying asset...",
            content: `<br><b>What is a structured product</b>? 
            <br>Structured products are usually packaged investments that  include interest rate-linked assets and one or more derivatives. These are typically associated with securities indexes or baskets and are designed to allow for highly customized risk-return targets. It employs traditional security, such as traditional investment grade bonds, and replaces regular payment functions (regular coupons and useful life capital) with non-traditional payments derived from the performance of the underlying asset. It will be realized by. Issuer's own cash flow. 
            <br><br><b>Origin</b>
            <br>One of the main reasons for creating structured products was that companies needed to issue cheap debt securities. Originally popular in Europe and popular in the United States, it is often offered as a SEC-registered product and is available to individual investors as well as stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and investment trusts. increase. Funds. Their ability to offer customized exposure to otherwise hardtoreach asset classes and subclasses make structured products useful as a complement to traditional components of diversified portfolios. 
            <br><br><b>Returns</b> 
            <br>Issuers normally pay returns on structured products once it reaches maturity. Payoffs or returns from these performance outcomes are contingent in the sense that, if the underlying assets return "x," then the structured product pays out "y." This means that structured products are closely related to traditional models of options pricing, although they may also contain other derivative categories such as swaps, forwards, and futures, as well as embedded features that include leveraged upside participation or downside buffers. 
            <br><br><b>Looking Under the Hood </b>
            <br>Consider that a wellknown bank issues structured products in the form of notes—each with a notional face value of $1,000. Each note is actually a package that consists of two components: A zerocoupon bond and a call option on an underlying equity instrument such as common stock or an ETF that mimics a popular index like the S&P 500. The maturity is three years. 
            <br>Although the pricing mechanisms that drive these values are complex, the underlying principle is fairly simple. On the issue date, you pay the face amount of $1,000. This note is fully principalprotected, meaning you will get your $1,000 back at maturity no matter what happens to the underlying asset. This is accomplished via the zerocoupon bond accreting from its original issue discount to face value.
            <br>For the performance component, the underlying asset is priced as a European call option and will have intrinsic value at maturity if its value on that date is higher than its value when issued. If applicable, you earn that return on a oneforone basis. Otherwise, the option will expire to no value and you will not receive anything above the $1,000 return on investment.

            title: "9 Best Personal Loan Tips",
            description: "Are you contemplating taking a personal loan to fund a large payment? A personal loan can definitely help you...",
            content: `
            <br>Are you thinking of taking a personal loan to fund a large payment? Personal loans can definitely help you pay for your various loan needs such as: B. Plan family vacations, weddings, home remodeling and more. The paperwork process is  not as complicated as  other loans, except that it does not require collateral. 
            <br>Therefore, taking a personal loan may seem very easy. However, there are some important things to consider when looking for a personal loan. Read our list of 9 most practical tips that will definitely help you with your personal loan. 
            <br><br><b>Make a loan only when absolutely necessary </b>
            <br>Personal loans should only be obtained after a thorough review of your requirements and  existing credit / repayment obligations. Loans can help you pay for short-term goals, but it's important to understand that they are additional payments for the next few months / year that you absolutely must make. Therefore, it is essential to  be able to make  monthly payments within the range of your monthly income. 
            <br><br><b>Do a thorough investigation before applying </b>
            <br>With the proliferation of individual loan providers and their bold claims, it is possible to steal the most attractive loan offers without having to read the terms  carefully. Therefore, it is important to do a thorough investigation before choosing a personal loan. Compare features such as interest rates, loan duration, and processing fees and choose the loan provider that suits your financial needs. 
            <br><br><b>Find the lowest interest rate </b>
            <br>Personal loans usually have high interest rates because the collateral is not guaranteed. Interest you pay is high, so even a small difference in  interest rates can mean a big difference in the total amount you  have to pay  interest. This makes it very important to look for loan providers that can offer you a good deal on interest rate based on your credit score and requirements. 
            <br><br><b>Check Eligibility Criteria </b>
            <br>Before you narrow down on the bank and the loan that best suits your needs, make sure you check that you meet the eligibility criteria of the loan you are interested in. One of the most important eligibility criteria is your income and credit score, as these indicate your loan repayment ability. The higher your income and credit score is, the more likely you are to get a personal loan for a higher amount 
            <br><br><b>Maintain High Credit Score </b>
            <br>Along with your income, a high credit score will definitely boost your chances of getting a personal loan with the desired interest rate and tenure. This is because a low credit score will be an indication of a poor repayment history causing banks to be apprehensive about granting loans to you. Therefore, it is very important to pay off all debt and unpaid credit card invoices before applying for a new loan. 
            <br><br><b>Please note the additional charge </b>
            <br>Before applying for a personal loan from a bank, you need to consider other factors besides interest rates and terms, such as: B. Fees. 
            <br><br><b>Check prepaid charges </b>
            <br>Prepaid is the repayment of a loan by the official due date. By paying the full amount or paying a portion of the repayment. Prepaid options are only allowed by certain banks and loan providers, but usually require additional payment from the borrower. This can only  be done  12 months after the loan is approved. It is important to check the prepayment terms before completing your personal loan. 
            <br><br><b>Repay within the deadline </b>
            <br>Any loan or credit you borrow is a promise to pay it diligently and reliably over months / years. Timely repayments not only prevent unnecessary penalties, but  also prevent your credit score from being adversely affected. Maintaining a good repayment history is important for maintaining a strong credit score. This will  help you get more credit / loans in the future. 
            <br><br><b>Shorten loan term </b>
            <br>You may come across a lender with a low EMI option and a very long repayment period. This is very attractive. However, keep in mind that with such a long-term loan, the total interest you  have to pay can be very high.

            title: "Credit Card Tips and Advice",
            description: "The terms ‘investing’ and ‘trading’ are often used interchangeably...",
            content: `<br>Your first credit card can be a step towards building a strong economic future and great credit. Or it could result in a pile of debt that would be difficult to repay over the years. Before using your first credit card, here are some tips to get you on the right track. 
            <br><br><b>Set a budget </b>
            <br>Credit cards are a convenient way to buy and earn rewards, but you shouldn't use them to buy something you can't afford. If you have a realistic idea of how much you can spend to withdraw at the end of the month, you will not overwhelm yourself. Try using a budget like the 
            50/30/20 method. It suggests spending 50% of net salary on necessities such as housing and groceries, spending less than 30%  on what is needed and saving more than 20%. Pay things and pay off your debt. This will help you match your credit card spending  with your income and other savings and spending priorities. 
            <br><br><b>Track purchases </b>
            <br>The first step is to calculate the amount you can afford. Then use your credit card mobile app or website to carefully track your purchases throughout the month. Once you reach your monthly spending limit, do not use your card until you have paid your balance. This kind of discipline will help you build  good credit  and keep you away from credit card debt. 
            <br><br><b>Set up automatic payment </b>
            <br>It may take some time to get used to paying your monthly invoice. Schedule automatic payments before the due date to prevent late credit card billing. Make sure you have more scheduled payments than your minimum payment (ideally for your entire balance) and that you have enough funds in your checking account before scheduling payments. Otherwise, you may be charged for late  or repaid payments. Try to pay all credit card invoices on time to keep your score high. Your credit card payments are paid on the same day every month, so you can easily meet your payment deadline. 
            <br><br><b>Use as little credit limit as possible </b>
            <br>You may want to get the most out  of your credit card. Up to the credit limit, but it's important not to do this. Credit usage, or the amount of credit limit you use, is the second largest factor in your credit score. If you pile up a large credit card balance and carry it monthly, it can hurt your score. Also, it  can take a long time to settle your credit card debt. Using  30% of the 3 credit limit is usually better for your credit score. 
            <br><br><b>Pay in full every month </b>
            <br>Credit card issuers only require a minimum payment amount, which is a percentage of the outstanding balance. This sounds much easier and cheaper than paying the full amount you owe, but it will cost you money over time. If you pay only the minimum amount, interest will be added to your monthly balance  until you finally pay the full amount. Your balance will  decrease slightly each month as some of your payments will be applied to accrued interest. What is the conclusion? Please repay your balance in full each month to avoid paying interest.

The RHB credit cards can be applied to any type of business as long as they have been in operation for at least 5 years. The cards will receive dual statements both for the employee or person using the card and a secondary statement for the business owner to track their business spending. 
            <br><br><b>RHB Travel Insurance Coverage </b>
            <br>Travelling and trying to enjoy your vacation while worrying about emergencies and flight plans can be stressful. With some RHB credit cards, you can get free travel insurance by purchasing a ticket with an RHB card. Enjoy  up to RM2 million free compensation for travel inconveniences such as baggage delays, lost baggage, flight delays and flight cancellations. Travel benefits also include free unlimited access to Malaysian and Singapore airport lounges. 
            <br><br><b>RHB balance transfer with smart move </b>
            <br>Shifting your credit card  balance to an RHB credit card can lower your overall interest rates. The RHB Smart Move Balance Transfer Plan offers a low interest rate of 4.99% per annum and a repayment period of up to 36 months. In addition, there are no prepaid fees for transfers or payments. 
            <br><br><b>What is the interest rate on the  RHB card? </b>
            <br>Like most banks in Malaysia, RHB adheres to the gradual interest rate of 15% to 18% per annum  recommended by Central Bank of Malaysia. Of course, credit card interest rates also depend heavily on people's repayments and consumption habits. Inconsistent repayments and high outstanding balances are more likely to raise monthly interest rates. 
            <br><br><b>What are the minimum monthly repayments for RHB credit cards? </b>
            <br>RHB Bank credit cardholders are required to make minimum monthly repayments of 5% of the current balance or a minimum of RM50, whichever is higher. If your full payment is made within the 20-day grace period then of course no interest is charged. Failure to do so may result in a late payment charge of a minimum of RM10 or 1% of total outstanding balance (excluding interests and fees), whichever is higher and up to a maximum of RM100

            content: `<br>When you apply for a credit card, you will be given  credit card restrictions. This amount is the maximum amount that can be used on the card. You need to know your credit limits to avoid unnecessary charges and  impact  on your credit score. 
            <br><br><b>What are credit card restrictions? </b>
            <br>Credit limits are the amount you can use with your credit card. It is set by your lender and determines the amount of debt you can build up. For example, if your credit card has a limit of RM 2,000 and your balance is Rm 1,500, you can only add RM 500 to  your card. 
            <br><br><b>What  if I exceed my credit card limit? </b>
            <br>Generally, you cannot exceed your credit card limit. If you try to use more than your remaining balance, your credit card will be rejected. However,  these transactions may be executed and the credit limit may be exceeded. In this case, you  will usually be charged a penalty  of up to RM12. If you regularly exceed your credit limit, your card provider may lower your limit, close your account, or remove any promotional fees you have. It can also affect your credit score.
             However, if you're usually good at managing your account  and accidentally exceed your allowance, it's a good idea to contact your credit card provider right away. They can be exempt from charges on request. 
            <br><br><b>Which credit limit should I consider? </b>
            <br>Your credit limit is set by your lender, taking into account your income, credit history and existing debt, and the amount of credit you have access to. There are no ideal credit card limits as this is a personal amount and will fluctuate. The average credit card limit is between RM 3,000 and RM 4,000. High-income earners with  good credit history can get a limit of up to RM 10,000, while those with  limited credit history or bad credit can only get a credit limit of RM1,000 or less.
             You want to make sure there are credit card restrictions that allow you to use your card the way you like, but don't run out of debt you can't afford to repay. 
            <br><br><b>How your credit limit affects your creditworthiness </b>
            <br>Credit card restrictions can affect your credit score in several ways: 
            <br><br><b>Searches.</b> When you request an increase in your credit limit, your provider will search your credit report. This search is flagged in the report. If you search for a loan too much, your credit score may drop because you appear to be anxious for cash.  
            <br><br><b>Available credits.</b> Your credit limit will appear in your credit report along with your outstanding balance. The difference between the two is the available balance. The lender will evaluate the amount of credit you have when reviewing the application. The limit has been exceeded. Exceeding  your credit limit on a regular basis can cause financial problems and  affect your credit score. 
            <br><br><b>How can I raise my credit limit?  </b>
            <br>Many credit card issuers are considering raising their credit card limit every six months. You can also contact your card provider or fill out an online account form to request an increase in your credit limit. When assessing whether to increase your limits, your lender will tell you your credit history, how you  used your credit card, and whether you  paid your invoice on time. watch. Your credit card provider may automatically increase your credit limit, but you can ask  not to  increase it, or if you set your own borrowing limit, you can lower your credit card limit.

            content: `<b>What are emergency funds for?</b><br>
            An emergency fund is a stash of money set aside to cover the financial surprises life throws your way. These unexpected events can be stressful and costly.<br><br>
            
            <b>Here are some of the top emergencies people face:</b>
            <br>
            1. Job loss.<br>
            2. Medical or dental emergency.<br>
            3. Unexpected home repairs.<br>
            4. Car troubles.<br>
            5. Unplanned travel expenses.<br><br>

            <b>3 benefits of having emergency money</b><br>
Aside from financial stability, there are other pros to having an emergency reserve of cash.<br>
            1. It helps keep your stress level down.<br>
            It's no surprise that when life presents an emergency, it threatens your financial well-being and causes stress. If you're living without a safety net, you're living on the "financial" edge—hoping to get by without running into a crisis.

            Being prepared with an emergency fund gives you confidence that you can tackle any of life's unexpected events without adding money worries to your list.<br><br>
            2. It keeps you from spending on a whim.<br>
            You've heard the saying "out of sight, out of mind." That's the best way to store your emergency money. If the cash is only as far away as your closest debit card, you may be tempted to use it for something frivolous like a designer cocktail dress or big-screen TV—not exactly an emergency.

            Keeping the money out of your immediate reach means you can't spend it on a whim, no matter how much you'd like to.
            
            And by putting it in a separate account, you'll know exactly how much you have—and how much you may still need to save.<br><br>

            3. It keeps you from making bad financial decisions.<br>
            There may be other ways you can quickly access cash, like borrowing, but at what cost? Interest, fees, and penalties are just some of the drawbacks.<br><br>
